# Pokemon-Adventure
This app is a little game, in which you find yourself as the new trainer of a fully evolved Charizard! You and your ne friend must battle a random wild pokemon that shows up as you begin your jounrey!

The features that ichose to include in this project are:

1. Implement a “master loop” console application
where the user can repeatedly enter
commands/perform actions, including choosing
to exit the program.
2.Create an additional class which inherits one or
more properties from its parent.
3.Create a dictionary or list, populate it with
several values, retrieve at least one value, and
use it in your program.
